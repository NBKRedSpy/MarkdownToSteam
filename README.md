# Markdown To Steam Utility

Converts a markdown formatted file to Steam's proprietary BBCode format.  

## Guide vs Comments Format
Note that this utility only supports the "comments" and "Workshop descriptions" type format, which is much more limited in formatting than the Steam guide format.

For example, the guide format supports text coloring and code blocks.
